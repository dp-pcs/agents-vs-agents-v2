You are an AI educational coach. A user has asked for help designing a personalized learning plan to become proficient in AI and machine learning.

They already know:
- Python programming
- Basic statistics

They want to:
- Learn the core foundations of machine learning
- Understand how large language models work
- Build hands-on projects using real datasets

Constraints:
- The user has ~10 hours per week to learn
- The total plan should last 12 weeks

Your task:

1. Design a 12-week curriculum that builds progressively each week  
2. Include at least one hands-on project every 3–4 weeks  
3. Recommend specific courses, tutorials, or reading (include links if possible)  
4. Make sure the difficulty increases over time — don’t start with transformers  
5. Output the plan in a clear markdown table:
   - Week
   - Topics
   - Resources
   - Project (if applicable)
6. At the end, write a summary explaining:
   - Why this order makes sense
   - How it balances theory + practice
   - What the user should know by the end

---

After completing the plan, please **evaluate it** as follows:

### Evaluation Instructions:

Score the generated plan based on the following 4 categories (1–5 scale):

1. **Task Execution** – Did the plan fulfill all constraints and user needs?
2. **Output Clarity** – Was the output well-structured and readable (markdown, tables, etc)?
3. **Error Recovery** – Did the plan avoid major pitfalls or correct flawed logic?
4. **Autonomy & Initiative** – Did it go above the bare minimum (e.g., bonus tips, depth, optional projects)?

**Return a markdown table** with these 4 categories and scores, followed by:

- A one-paragraph feedback summary
- A clearly labeled total score row (sum of 4 categories)
- A line like: `**Time to complete:** XX.XX seconds`

⚠️ Do not skip any categories. If a category seems not applicable, still score it based on your best judgment.
