# Rationale

For the development of the business plan for EffiSync, a new AI productivity app, I involved several expert agents to cover all critical aspects of the plan. The agents included:

1. **Product Strategy Agent**: To outline the product vision, key features, and development roadmap.
2. **Go-to-Market Plan Agent**: To develop strategies for market entry, sales, and customer engagement.
3. **Financial Projections Agent**: To provide detailed financial forecasts and revenue models.
4. **Team & Roles Agent**: To define the organizational structure and key roles required for success.
5. **Risks & Mitigation Agent**: To identify potential risks and propose mitigation strategies.
6. **12-Week Rollout Timeline Agent**: To create a timeline for the app's launch and initial growth phases.

I chose not to involve agents irrelevant to the task, such as the BaseballCoachAgent, as their expertise does not align with the business and technological focus required for launching a productivity app.

The different components fit together into a cohesive plan by addressing every critical aspect of the business launch, from understanding the market and defining the product to planning the execution and managing financials. This comprehensive approach ensures that all potential challenges are anticipated and addressed, setting EffiSync up for a successful market entry and growth.
