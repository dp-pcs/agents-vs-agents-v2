## OpenAI Evaluation

Project**: Text Generation with GPT-2 |

---

This curriculum starts with the basics of machine learning, introducing the concepts of supervised and unsupervised learning. It then moves on to specific algorithms, starting with simple ones like linear and logistic regression, and gradually introduces more complex models like decision trees, SVMs, and clustering algorithms. This ensures a solid foundation before moving on to neural networks and deep learning.

The curriculum also balances theory and practice, with hands-on projects every three weeks. These projects allow the user to apply what they've learned and gain practical experience with real datasets.

By the end of the curriculum, the user should have a solid understanding of the core concepts of machine learning, be familiar with a range of algorithms, and have experience applying these algorithms to real-world problems. They should also understand how large language models work and have experience using them in a project.
