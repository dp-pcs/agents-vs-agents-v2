| 12 | Capstone Project | | Build a transformer model for text classification or generation |

This curriculum starts with the core foundations of machine learning in weeks 1-4, covering key concepts like supervised and unsupervised learning. It includes Andrew Ng's popular Coursera course and relevant chapters from the Hands-On Machine Learning book. The first project provides hands-on practice with basic ML.

Weeks 5-8 dive into neural networks and deep learning, following the Coursera Deep Learning specialization. This builds a solid understanding of key architectures like CNNs and RNNs. Another hands-on project reinforces these learnings.

The final weeks cover more advanced topics like transformers, transfer learning, and generative models. Tutorials and papers provide exposure to these techniques. The capstone project challenges the user to apply their skills to a substantial task.

By the end, the user should have a strong grasp of core ML concepts, deep learning fundamentals, and experience implementing models for real applications. The mix of courses, books, papers, and projects balances theory and practice. The difficulty ramps up gradually, leading to a good understanding of both classical ML and modern deep learning.
