It then progresses to neural networks and deep learning, covering essential architectures like CNNs, RNNs, and transformers. Hands-on projects are included every 3-4 weeks to reinforce the concepts learned. \n\nThe order allows the learner to build up their theoretical knowledge while getting practical experience. They start with classic ML before moving to basic neural nets, then more advanced architectures. The difficulty gradually increases, with transformers and attention coming towards the end.\n\nBy the end of 12 weeks, the learner should have a solid foundation in ML and deep learning. They will understand core concepts, key architectures, and how large language models work. The projects will give them experience working with real data to solve practical problems. With this base, they can dive deeper into areas of interest or start applying ML in their work.\n\n### Evaluation:\n\n| Category | Score | Explanation |\n|----------|-------|-------------|\n| Task Execution | 5 | The plan fulfills all the user's requirements and constraints. It covers the requested topics in a 12-week timeframe with ~10 hours per week of study. |\n| Output Clarity | 5 | The curriculum is laid out in a clear week-by-week table with topics, resources, and projects. The summary is well-written and explains the plan's logic. |\n| Error Recovery | 4 | The plan avoids major pitfalls by building concepts progressively. One potential issue is the RNN/LSTM section could use more resources beyond one tutorial. |\n| Autonomy & Initiative | 4 | The plan goes beyond the minimum by recommending specific courses/tutorials and increasing difficulty over time. Bonus points for the CNN Explainer and Illustrated Transformer/BERT guides. Could have included a few more optional advanced topics or challenge exercises. |\n\n**Feedback Summary:**\nThis is a comprehensive, well-structured plan for learning AI/ML from the ground up.
