## CrewAI with OpenAI Output

Here is a 12-week curriculum for learning AI and Machine Learning:

| Week | Topics | Resources | Project |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Introduction to Machine Learning | [Coursera: Machine Learning by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) (Week 1) | - |
| 2 | Linear Regression with Multiple Variables | Coursera: Machine Learning by Andrew Ng (Week 2) | - |
| 3 | Logistic Regression, Regularization | Coursera: Machine Learning by Andrew Ng (Week 3) | Project 1: Predicting House Prices using Linear Regression |
| 4 | Neural Networks: Representation | Coursera: Machine Learning by Andrew Ng (Week 4) | - |
| 5 | Neural Networks: Learning | Coursera: Machine Learning by Andrew Ng (Week 5) | - |
| 6 | Advice for Applying Machine Learning, Machine Learning System Design | Coursera: Machine Learning by Andrew Ng (Week 6) | Project 2: Handwritten Digit Recognition using Neural Networks |
| 7 | Support Vector Machines | Coursera: Machine Learning by Andrew Ng (Week 7) | - |
| 8 | Unsupervised Learning, Dimensionality Reduction | Coursera: Machine Learning by Andrew Ng (Week 8) | Project 3: Customer Segmentation using K-means Clustering |
| 9 | Anomaly Detection, Recommender Systems | Coursera: Machine Learning by Andrew Ng (Week 9) | - |
| 10 | Large Scale Machine Learning | Coursera: Machine Learning by Andrew Ng (Week 10) | - |
| 11 | Introduction to Large Language Models | [OpenAI: GPT-3 Creative Writing](https://beta.openai.com/playground/) | Project 4: Text Generation using GPT-3 |
| 12 | Review and Project Completion | - | Final Project: Building a Recommender System |

Summary:

This order makes sense because it starts with the basics of machine learning and gradually introduces more complex topics such as neural networks and large language models. It ensures a solid foundation before moving on to more advanced topics.

The curriculum balances theory and practice by including a hands-on project every 3-4 weeks. These projects allow the user to apply what they've learned in a practical way.

By the end of this curriculum, the user should have a solid understanding of machine learning, including how to implement various algorithms and use them to solve real-world problems. They should also have a basic understanding of how large language models work and how to use them for tasks such as text generation.

## Claude Evaluation

Here is the evaluation of the generated 12-week AI/ML learning plan:

| Category | Score (1-5) |
| --- | --- |
| Task Execution | 4 |
| Output Clarity | 5 |
| Error Recovery | 4 |
| Autonomy & Initiative | 3 |
| **Total Score** | **16** |

Feedback summary:
The generated plan does a good job of progressively covering key ML topics over 12 weeks, with a nice balance of theory and hands-on projects using real datasets. The output is very clear and well-structured using markdown tables. The curriculum follows a logical order and avoids major pitfalls. However, it could have shown more initiative by including supplemental readings, coding exercises between projects, or stretch goals for advanced learners.
