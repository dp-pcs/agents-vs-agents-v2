Summary:
This curriculum starts with the core fundamentals of machine learning, including key concepts and classical algorithms like linear regression and decision trees. It then progresses to more advanced topics like neural networks and deep learning architectures. 

The order allows the learner to build a strong foundation before moving to complex models. Hands-on projects after every few weeks of learning help reinforce concepts through practical application. The projects also increase in complexity, from structured data to unstructured data like images and text.

A variety of learning resources are included, such as online courses, tutorials, and conceptual guides. This allows the learner to go at their own pace and learn in different formats.

By the end of the curriculum, the learner will have a solid understanding of key machine learning concepts and algorithms. They will know how to train and apply various models, from linear regression to transformers. The projects will equip them with practical experience working with different types of data and problem statements. Overall, they will be ready to dive deeper into specific areas of interest and build more advanced ML applications.
