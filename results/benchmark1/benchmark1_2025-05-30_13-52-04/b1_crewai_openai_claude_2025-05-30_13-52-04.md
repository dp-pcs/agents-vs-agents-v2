## CrewAI with OpenAI Output

Here is the 12-week curriculum:

| Week | Topics | Resources | Project |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Introduction to Machine Learning | [Intro to Machine Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120) | - |
| 2 | Supervised Learning | [Supervised Learning with scikit-learn](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/supervised-learning-with-scikit-learn) | - |
| 3 | Unsupervised Learning | [Unsupervised Learning in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/unsupervised-learning-in-python) | - |
| 4 | Project 1: Supervised Learning and Unsupervised Learning | - | Apply supervised and unsupervised learning on a real dataset |
| 5 | Deep Learning Basics | [Deep Learning A-Zâ„¢: Hands-On Artificial Neural Networks](https://www.udemy.com/course/deeplearning/) | - |
| 6 | Convolutional Neural Networks | [Convolutional Neural Networks in Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/convolutional-neural-networks-in-python/) | - |
| 7 | Recurrent Neural Networks | [Deep Learning: Recurrent Neural Networks in Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/deep-learning-recurrent-neural-networks-in-python/) | - |
| 8 | Project 2: Deep Learning | - | Apply deep learning on a real dataset |
| 9 | Introduction to Large Language Models | [Illustrated Guide to Transformers](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/) | - |
| 10 | Working with Large Language Models | [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/) | - |
| 11 | Fine-tuning Large Language Models | [Fine-tuning Large Language Models](https://huggingface.co/transformers/training.html) | - |
| 12 | Project 3: Large Language Models | - | Apply a large language model on a real dataset |

This order makes sense because it starts with the basics of machine learning, then moves on to more complex topics like deep learning and large language models. This allows the user to build a strong foundation before tackling more advanced topics.

The curriculum balances theory and practice by including a hands-on project every 3-4 weeks. These projects allow the user to apply the concepts they've learned in a practical setting.

By the end of this curriculum, the user should have a solid understanding of machine learning, deep learning, and large language models. They should also have experience applying these concepts to real datasets.

## Claude Evaluation

Here is my evaluation of the generated 12-week AI/ML learning plan:

| Category | Score (1-5) |
| --- | --- |
| Task Execution | 5 |
| Output Clarity | 5 |
| Error Recovery | 4 |
| Autonomy & Initiative | 3 |
| **Total Score** | **17** |

**Feedback Summary:**
The generated plan does an excellent job fulfilling the user's needs and constraints. It covers the requested topics in a logical progression, includes hands-on projects, and provides specific resource recommendations. The output is well-structured and easy to follow. One potential improvement would be spending more time on the fundamentals before jumping into deep learning in week 5. The plan could also show more initiative by suggesting stretch goals or additional projects for advanced learners.
