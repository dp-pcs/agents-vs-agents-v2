Summary:
This curriculum starts with the fundamentals of machine learning, including key concepts, supervised learning algorithms like linear regression and decision trees, and unsupervised learning techniques like clustering and dimensionality reduction. It includes hands-on practice with scikit-learn and real datasets.

The curriculum then progresses to deep learning, starting with the basics of neural networks before moving on to convolutional nets for computer vision and recurrent nets for sequence data. A deep learning project helps solidify these concepts.

In the final weeks, the curriculum covers more advanced topics like the transformer architecture and how it powers large language models like GPT. It touches on practical aspects like deploying models and discusses important AI ethics issues. A final project ties everything together.

By the end, the user should have a solid foundation in the key algorithms and techniques of machine learning and deep learning. They will understand how models are trained on data and how architectures like CNNs, RNNs, and transformers work. Hands-on projects will give them practical experience building models for real applications.

The curriculum balances theory and practice, and gradually builds up to more advanced topics. It provides a comprehensive introduction to modern AI and machine learning techniques and should prepare the user well for further learning and applying their skills to new projects.
