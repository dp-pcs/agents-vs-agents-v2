## CrewAI with OpenAI Output

Here is a 12-week curriculum designed to progressively build your understanding of AI and machine learning:

| Week | Topics | Resources | Project |
|------|--------|-----------|---------|
| 1 | Introduction to Machine Learning | [Intro to Machine Learning (Udacity)](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120) | |
| 2 | Supervised Learning | [Supervised Learning (Stanford University)](https://see.stanford.edu/Course/CS229) | |
| 3 | Unsupervised Learning | [Unsupervised Learning (Stanford University)](https://see.stanford.edu/Course/CS229) | |
| 4 | Project: Supervised Learning | | Apply supervised learning techniques on a real dataset |
| 5 | Deep Learning Basics | [Deep Learning (Udacity)](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning--ud730) | |
| 6 | Neural Networks | [Neural Networks and Deep Learning (Coursera)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning) | |
| 7 | Project: Deep Learning | | Apply deep learning techniques on a real dataset |
| 8 | Introduction to Large Language Models | [Transformer Models for Language Understanding (Coursera)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/transformer-models-for-language-understanding) | |
| 9 | Advanced Topics in Large Language Models | [Attention Is All You Need (Paper)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) | |
| 10 | Project: Large Language Models | | Apply a large language model on a real dataset |
| 11 | Ethics in AI and Machine Learning | [Ethics in AI and Big Data (LinkedIn Learning)](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/ethics-in-ai-and-big-data) | |
| 12 | Project: Final Project | | Combine all learned techniques in a final project |

This order makes sense because it starts with the basics of machine learning, moves onto deep learning, and then delves into large language models. Each topic builds on the previous one, ensuring a gradual increase in difficulty. 

The curriculum balances theory and practice by alternating between learning weeks and project weeks. This allows you to apply what you've learned in a hands-on manner, reinforcing your understanding.

By the end of this curriculum, you should have a solid understanding of machine learning, deep learning, and large language models. You'll also have completed several projects using real datasets, demonstrating your ability to apply these techniques in practice.

## Claude Evaluation

Here is my evaluation of the generated 12-week AI/ML learning plan:

| Category | Score (1-5) |
|----------|-------------|
| Task Execution | 5 |
| Output Clarity | 5 |  
| Error Recovery | 4 |
| Autonomy & Initiative | 4 |
|----------|-------------|
| **Total Score** | **18** |

Feedback summary: The generated learning plan does an excellent job fulfilling the user's needs and constraints. It covers the requested topics in a logical progression, includes hands-on projects, and provides specific resource recommendations. The markdown table output is clear and well-structured. While the plan doesn't contain any major errors, it could have gone a bit further in the "Ethics in AI" section given the importance of that topic. Some additional optional stretch projects or enrichment readings could also enhance the plan. But overall, this is a comprehensive, well-designed curriculum that balances theory and practice effectively.
