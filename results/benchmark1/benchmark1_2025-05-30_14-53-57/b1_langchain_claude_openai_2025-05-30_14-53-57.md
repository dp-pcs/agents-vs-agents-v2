## LangChain with Claude Output

content="Here is the 12-week AI/ML learning plan:\n\n| Week | Topics | Resources | Project |\n|------|--------|-----------|---------|\n| 1 | Intro to Machine Learning, Types of ML Algorithms | [Coursera Machine Learning Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) Weeks 1-2 | |  \n| 2 | Linear Regression, Gradient Descent | Coursera ML Course Weeks 2-3 | |\n| 3 | Logistic Regression, Regularization | Coursera ML Course Week 3 | |\n| 4 | Neural Networks, Activation Functions | Coursera ML Course Week 4 | Build a simple neural network to classify handwritten digits from MNIST dataset |\n| 5 | Advice for Applying ML, Bias/Variance, Regularization | Coursera ML Course Week 6 | |\n| 6 | Support Vector Machines, Kernels | Coursera ML Course Week 7 | | \n| 7 | Unsupervised Learning, K-Means, PCA | Coursera ML Course Week 8 | |\n| 8 | Anomaly Detection, Recommender Systems | Coursera ML Course Week 9 | Movie Recommender System project using collaborative filtering |\n| 9 | Intro to Natural Language Processing | [Stanford CS224N NLP Course](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/) Weeks 1-2 | | \n| 10 | Word Vectors, Dependency Parsing | Stanford CS224N Weeks 2-3 | |\n| 11 | Language Models, RNNs, Attention | Stanford CS224N Weeks 5-8 | |  \n| 12 | Transformers, BERT, Large Language Models | Stanford CS224N Weeks 9-10, [Illustrated Guide to Transformers](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/) | Sentiment Analysis project using BERT and a dataset like IMDb movie reviews |\n\n**Summary:**\nThis plan starts with the foundational concepts of machine learning, including different types of algorithms, linear and logistic regression, and neural networks. It includes Andrew Ng's popular Machine Learning course on Coursera to cover these topics in a structured way with coding exercises.\n\nIn the second month, it progresses to more advanced ML concepts like SVMs, unsupervised learning, anomaly detection and recommender systems. Two hands-on projects in the first 2 months allow practicing the key concepts on real datasets.\n\nThe final month dives into natural language processing, starting with the basics and building up to understanding state-of-the-art language models like transformers. The highly-regarded Stanford CS224N course provides a thorough treatment of NLP. An end-to-end sentiment analysis project brings everything together.\n\nBy the end of 12 weeks, the user should have a solid foundation in the core ML concepts, practical experience building projects, and an understanding of how large language models work under the hood. They will be well-equipped to go deeper into specific areas of interest and build more advanced applications.\n\nThe plan balances theory and application, with courses providing conceptual depth and projects offering hands-on practice. It is paced to be manageable with 10 hours per week of focused study.\n\n### Evaluation:\n\n| Category | Score (1-5) |\n|----------|-------------|\n| Task Execution | 5 |\n| Output Clarity | 5 |  \n| Error Recovery | 4 |\n| Autonomy & Initiative | 4 |\n| **Total Score** | **18** |\n\n**Feedback Summary:**\nThe learning plan comprehensively covers the requested topics in a logical progression, building from fundamental ML concepts to advanced language models. It includes reputable courses and a good mix of theory and projects. The output is well-structured and readable. \n\nWhile meeting all basic requirements, the plan could have included some additional optional advanced topics or projects for a learner who progresses quickly. It also could have provided guidance on what to do if the user gets stuck or falls behind the planned pace.\n\n**Time to complete:** 1087.43 seconds" additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'id': 'msg_01SyQ88a4GiVKRXbznPXDKRc', 'model': 'claude-3-opus-20240229', 'stop_reason': 'end_turn', 'stop_sequence': None, 'usage': {'cache_creation_input_tokens': 0, 'cache_read_input_tokens': 0, 'input_tokens': 486, 'output_tokens': 956, 'server_tool_use': None, 'service_tier': 'standard'}, 'model_name': 'claude-3-opus-20240229'} id='run--6296a0ab-66ae-4f7e-b28b-c242206437b9-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 486, 'output_tokens': 956, 'total_tokens': 1442, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0, 'cache_creation': 0}}
