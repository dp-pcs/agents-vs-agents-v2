## CrewAI with OpenAI Output

Here is a 12-week curriculum that progressively builds on each week, includes hands-on projects, and balances theory and practice:

| Week | Topics | Resources | Project |
|------|--------|-----------|---------|
| 1 | Introduction to Machine Learning | [Coursera: Machine Learning by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) (Week 1) | None |
| 2 | Linear Regression with Multiple Variables | Coursera: Machine Learning by Andrew Ng (Week 2) | Implement Linear Regression on a dataset |
| 3 | Logistic Regression, Regularization | Coursera: Machine Learning by Andrew Ng (Week 3) | Implement Logistic Regression on a dataset |
| 4 | Neural Networks: Representation | Coursera: Machine Learning by Andrew Ng (Week 4) | None |
| 5 | Neural Networks: Learning | Coursera: Machine Learning by Andrew Ng (Week 5) | Implement a Neural Network from scratch |
| 6 | Advice for Applying Machine Learning, Machine Learning System Design | Coursera: Machine Learning by Andrew Ng (Week 6) | None |
| 7 | Support Vector Machines (SVMs) | Coursera: Machine Learning by Andrew Ng (Week 7) | Implement SVM on a dataset |
| 8 | Unsupervised Learning, Dimensionality Reduction | Coursera: Machine Learning by Andrew Ng (Week 8) | Implement K-means Clustering and PCA on a dataset |
| 9 | Anomaly Detection, Recommender Systems | Coursera: Machine Learning by Andrew Ng (Week 9) | Build a simple Recommender System |
| 10 | Introduction to Large Language Models | [OpenAI: GPT-3 Explained](https://openai.com/research/gpt-3/) | None |
| 11 | Deep Dive into Transformer Models | [Illustrated Transformer by Jay Alammar](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/) | None |
| 12 | Hands-on with Large Language Models | [Hugging Face: Transformers Tutorial](https://huggingface.co/transformers/notebooks.html) | Implement a text generation task using a pre-trained transformer model |

This order makes sense because it starts with the basics of machine learning, gradually introduces more complex concepts, and finally moves on to large language models. The curriculum is designed to provide a balance of theory and practice, with hands-on projects every 2-3 weeks to reinforce the concepts learned.

By the end of this curriculum, the user should have a solid understanding of the core foundations of machine learning, how large language models work, and how to implement these models on real datasets. They will have hands-on experience with several machine learning algorithms and will have built several projects, including a text generation model using a pre-trained transformer.

## Claude Evaluation

Here is my evaluation of the generated 12-week AI/ML learning plan:

| Category | Score (1-5) |
|----------|-------------|
| Task Execution | 5 |
| Output Clarity | 5 |  
| Error Recovery | 4 |
| Autonomy & Initiative | 4 |
| **Total Score** | **18** |

Feedback summary: The generated plan does an excellent job fulfilling all the specified requirements and constraints. It provides a clear, well-structured 12-week curriculum that progressively covers key ML topics and includes regular hands-on projects. The markdown table format is highly readable. The plan logically builds from ML fundamentals to more advanced concepts like LLMs. One potential improvement would be including a few supplemental resources beyond just the Coursera course in weeks 1-9. But overall, this is a comprehensive, well-designed learning plan that balances theory and practice effectively.
