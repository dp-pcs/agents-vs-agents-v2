This learning plan starts with the basics of machine learning and gradually introduces more complex topics, ensuring a solid foundation is built before moving on to more advanced concepts. The first few weeks focus on fundamental ML concepts and algorithms, followed by a project to apply these learnings. The middle weeks introduce neural networks and their variants, with another project to reinforce understanding. The final weeks delve into NLP, transformers, and large language models, culminating in a final project. The plan concludes with a discussion on ethics in AI and bias in ML, important considerations for any AI practitioner. 

By the end of this plan, the user should have a strong understanding of machine learning, neural networks, NLP, and transformers. They will have hands-on experience building models and will be aware of ethical considerations in AI. This plan balances theory and practice by pairing learning resources with practical projects every few weeks, allowing the user to apply their knowledge and build confidence.
