## OpenAI Evaluation

| Week | Topics | Resources | Project |
|------|--------|-----------|---------|
| 13 | Large Language Models, GPT-3 | [Large Language Models](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/natural-language-processing-tensorflow/large-transformer-models-1m7Lj), [GPT-3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SY5PvZrJhLE) | [Text Generation with GPT-2](https://www.kaggle.com/valkling/gpt2-15c-text-generation) |

This curriculum starts with the basics of machine learning and gradually introduces more complex topics. The first few weeks are dedicated to understanding the core concepts of machine learning and getting familiar with different types of algorithms. The middle weeks focus on specific algorithms and techniques, while the last few weeks delve into deep learning and large language models.

The curriculum balances theory and practice by including a hands-on project every 3-4 weeks. These projects are designed to apply the concepts learned in the preceding weeks and provide practical experience with real datasets.

By the end of this curriculum, the user should be proficient in various machine learning algorithms, understand how large language models work, and have hands-on experience with real-world projects.
