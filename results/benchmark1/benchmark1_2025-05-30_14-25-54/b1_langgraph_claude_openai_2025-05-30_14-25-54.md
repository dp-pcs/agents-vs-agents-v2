Summary:
This curriculum starts with the fundamental concepts and algorithms of machine learning, including different types of learning, linear models, and evaluation metrics. It then progresses into neural networks and deep learning, covering the core architectures like CNNs and RNNs. Unsupervised learning methods are introduced later once the foundations are set.

Hands-on Python projects using real data are included every 3-4 weeks so that the theoretical
