## CrewAI with OpenAI Output

Here is a 12-week curriculum that builds progressively each week:

| Week | Topics | Resources | Project |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Introduction to Machine Learning | [Intro to Machine Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120) | - |
| 2 | Supervised Learning | [Supervised Learning with scikit-learn](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/supervised-learning-with-scikit-learn) | - |
| 3 | Unsupervised Learning | [Unsupervised Learning in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/unsupervised-learning-in-python) | - |
| 4 | Project 1: Supervised and Unsupervised Learning | - | Apply supervised and unsupervised learning techniques on a real dataset |
| 5 | Deep Learning Basics | [Deep Learning A-Z](https://www.udemy.com/course/deeplearning/) | - |
| 6 | Convolutional Neural Networks | [Convolutional Neural Networks in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/convolutional-neural-networks-in-python) | - |
| 7 | Recurrent Neural Networks | [Recurrent Neural Networks in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/recurrent-neural-networks-in-python) | - |
| 8 | Project 2: Deep Learning | - | Apply CNNs and RNNs on a real dataset |
| 9 | Introduction to Large Language Models | [GPT-2 and You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pDm_lnMX0o) | - |
| 10 | Fine-tuning Large Language Models | [How to Fine-Tune BERT for Text Classification?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05583) | - |
| 11 | Ethics and Limitations of AI | [Ethics of AI and Robotics](https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2018/entries/ethics-ai/) | - |
| 12 | Project 3: Large Language Models | - | Fine-tune a large language model on a real dataset |

This order makes sense because it starts with the basics of machine learning, then moves on to more advanced topics like deep learning and large language models. This ensures that the user has a solid foundation before tackling more complex topics.

The curriculum balances theory and practice by alternating between learning new concepts and applying them in hands-on projects. This allows the user to reinforce their learning and gain practical experience.

By the end of this curriculum, the user should be proficient in AI and machine learning. They should understand the core foundations of machine learning, know how large language models work, and have experience building hands-on projects using real datasets.

## Claude Evaluation

Here is my evaluation of the generated 12-week AI/ML learning plan:

| Category | Score (1-5) |
| --- | --- |
| Task Execution | 5 |
| Output Clarity | 5 |
| Error Recovery | 4 |
| Autonomy & Initiative | 4 |
| **Total Score** | **18** |

Feedback summary:
The generated plan does an excellent job fulfilling all the specified requirements and constraints. It covers the requested topics in a logical progression, includes regular hands-on projects, and provides specific resource recommendations with links. The markdown table format is clear and readable. The summary explains the reasoning behind the curriculum order and how it balances theory and practice. The only areas for potential improvement would be catching any prerequisite gaps (e.g. linear algebra, calculus) and providing more optional stretch goals or enrichment resources for highly motivated learners. But overall, this is a comprehensive, well-structured plan that should enable the user to gain proficiency in core AI/ML concepts and applications within the 12 week timeframe.
