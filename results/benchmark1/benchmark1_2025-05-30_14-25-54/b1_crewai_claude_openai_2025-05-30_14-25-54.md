| 11 | Introduction to Natural Language Processing, Bag of Words, TF-IDF | [Coursera: NLP](https://www.coursera.org/learn/language-processing), [Towards Data Science: BoW & TF-IDF](https://towardsdatascience.com/natural-language-processing-count-vectorization-with-scikit-learn-e7804269bb5e) | - |

The learning plan starts with the basics of machine learning and gradually moves towards more complex topics like neural networks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and finally large language models. This order makes sense as it builds upon the user's existing knowledge of Python and statistics, and progressively introduces more complex concepts. 

The plan balances theory and practice by including hands-on projects at regular intervals. These projects are designed to give the user practical experience with the concepts they've learned, and to help them understand how these concepts are applied in real-world scenarios.

By the end of this plan, the user should have a solid understanding of the core concepts of machine learning, including various types of neural networks, unsupervised learning techniques, natural language processing, and large language models. They should also have practical experience building machine learning models with real datasets.
