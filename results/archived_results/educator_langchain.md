**Summary:**

This learning plan starts with the basics of machine learning, gradually introducing more complex concepts and techniques. It makes sense to start with linear regression as it is the simplest form of machine learning and provides a solid foundation for understanding more complex algorithms. 

The course by Andrew Ng is chosen because it provides a good balance between theory and practice. It covers the mathematical underpinnings of machine learning algorithms, which is essential for understanding how they work and when to use them. It also includes programming assignments that allow the learner to implement these algorithms from scratch, reinforcing their understanding and providing hands-on experience.

The plan includes three projects spread out over the 12 weeks. These projects provide opportunities to apply the concepts and techniques learned in a practical context, using real datasets. They also provide a sense of accomplishment and tangible proof of learning.

By the end of this plan, the learner should have a solid understanding of the core concepts and techniques in machine learning, including linear and logistic regression, neural networks, support vector machines, unsupervised learning, and recommender systems. They should also have a basic understanding of deep learning and large language models, and be able to implement machine learning algorithms to solve real-world problems.
