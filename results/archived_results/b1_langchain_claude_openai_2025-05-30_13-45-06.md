content="Here is the 12-week AI/ML learning plan:\n\n| Week | Topics | Resources | Project |\n|------|--------|-----------|---------|\n| 1 | Intro to Machine Learning, types of ML algorithms | [Coursera Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) Week 1 | - |  \n| 2 | Linear Regression, Gradient Descent | Coursera ML Week 2 | - |\n| 3 | Logistic Regression, Regularization  | Coursera ML Week 3 | - |\n| 4 | Neural Networks, Activation Functions | Coursera ML Week 4 | Build a simple neural network to classify handwritten digits |\n| 5 | Backpropagation, Training Neural Nets | Coursera ML Week 5 | - |\n| 6 | Bias/Variance, ML System Design | Coursera ML Week 6 | - | \n| 7 | SVMs, Kernels, Clustering | Coursera ML Week 7 | - |\n| 8 | Dimensionality Reduction, Anomaly Detection | Coursera ML Week 8 | Kaggle ML competition (e.g. Titanic survival) |\n| 9 | Intro to Deep Learning, Convolutional Neural Nets | [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) Course 1 & 4 | - |\n| 10 | Sequence Models, Recurrent Neural Nets, LSTMs | DL Specialization Course 5 | - |\n| 11 | Transformer Architecture, Attention Mechanisms | [Illustrated Transformer](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/) | - | \n| 12 | Intro to Large Language Models, Prompt Engineering | [Prompt Engineering Guide](https://www.promptingguide.ai/) | Fine-tune a pre-trained language model on a classification task |\n\n#### Summary\nThis plan starts with the foundational concepts of machine learning, including different types of algorithms, linear models, and neural networks. It uses Andrew Ng's popular Machine Learning course to cover these topics in a progressive way.\n\nIn the second half, it transitions to deep learning, using the Deep Learning Specialization to understand CNNs, RNNs, and sequence models. The final weeks introduce more advanced concepts like the transformer architecture and large language models.\n\nHands-on projects are included every 3-4 weeks to reinforce the concepts learned. These projects increase in complexity, starting with a basic neural network implementation and building up to fine-tuning a pre-trained language model.\n\nBy the end of the 12 weeks, the user should have a solid grasp of the core ML concepts, experience implementing models in Python, and an understanding of the latest developments in deep learning and NLP. They will be well-equipped to dive deeper into specific areas of interest and work on more advanced projects.\n\n### Evaluation:\n\n| Category | Score (1-5) |\n|----------|-------------|\n| Task Execution | 5 |\n| Output Clarity | 5 |  \n| Error Recovery | 4 |\n| Autonomy & Initiative | 4 |\n| **Total Score** | **18** |\n\n**Feedback:** The learning plan comprehensively covers the requested topics in a logical progression, mixing theory and practice effectively. It fulfills all the given constraints. The output is well-structured and easy to follow. One potential improvement could be suggesting additional optional projects or resources for those who want to go deeper.
