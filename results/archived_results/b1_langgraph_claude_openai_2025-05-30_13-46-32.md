## OpenAI Evaluation

fairness-overview) | **Project**: Build a text generator using GPT-2 |

By the end of this plan, you should have a solid understanding of both the theoretical and practical aspects of machine learning and AI. The order of the topics follows a natural progression from basic to advanced concepts, starting with the fundamentals of machine learning and gradually moving towards more complex topics like neural networks, transformers, and reinforcement learning. 

The plan balances theory and practice by including a mix of video lectures, reading materials, and hands-on projects. The projects are designed to give you practical experience in applying the concepts you've learned, and they become more complex as you progress through the plan.

By the end of the 12 weeks, you should be able to understand and implement various machine learning algorithms, understand how large language models like GPT-2 and GPT-3 work, and be aware of the ethical considerations in AI.
