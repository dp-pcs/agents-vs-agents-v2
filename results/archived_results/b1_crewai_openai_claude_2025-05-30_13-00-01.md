## CrewAI with OpenAI Output

Here is a 12-week learning plan that progressively builds on foundational knowledge, includes hands-on projects, and gradually increases in difficulty:

| Week | Topics | Resources | Project |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Introduction to Machine Learning | [Intro to Machine Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120) | NA |
| 2 | Supervised Learning | [Supervised Learning with scikit-learn](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/supervised-learning-with-scikit-learn) | NA |
| 3 | Unsupervised Learning | [Unsupervised Learning in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/unsupervised-learning-in-python) | NA |
| 4 | Project 1: Supervised and Unsupervised Learning | NA | Use a real dataset to apply supervised and unsupervised learning techniques learned in weeks 2 and 3 |
| 5 | Deep Learning Basics | [Deep Learning by Google](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning--ud730) | NA |
| 6 | Convolutional Neural Networks | [Convolutional Neural Networks in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/convolutional-neural-networks-in-python) | NA |
| 7 | Project 2: Deep Learning | NA | Use a real dataset to build a deep learning model |
| 8 | Introduction to Natural Language Processing | [Natural Language Processing](https://www.coursera.org/learn/language-processing) | NA |
| 9 | Introduction to Large Language Models | [Illustrated Guide to Transformers](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/) | NA |
| 10 | Project 3: Natural Language Processing | NA | Use a real dataset to build a NLP model |
| 11 | Advanced Topics in Large Language Models | [Transformers for Natural Language Processing](https://www.coursera.org/learn/transformers-nlp) | NA |
| 12 | Project 4: Large Language Models | NA | Use a real dataset to build a model using a large language model |

This order makes sense as it starts with the basics of machine learning, then moves onto more complex topics such as deep learning and natural language processing. It also includes a project every 3-4 weeks to ensure the learner is able to apply the theory they've learned in a practical setting.

By the end of this 12-week plan, the learner should have a solid understanding of machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, and large language models. They should also have hands-on experience with applying these concepts to real datasets.

## Claude Evaluation

Here is the evaluation of the generated learning plan:

| Category | Score (1-5) |
| --- | --- |
| Task Execution | 5 |
| Output Clarity | 5 |
| Error Recovery | 4 |
| Autonomy & Initiative | 3 |
| **Total Score** | **17** |

Feedback summary:
The generated learning plan does an excellent job of fulfilling all the specified constraints and user needs. It progressively builds on foundational knowledge, includes hands-on projects at regular intervals, and gradually increases in difficulty. The output is well-structured and readable, using a clear markdown table format. The plan avoids major pitfalls and follows a logical progression. However, it could have shown more autonomy and initiative by including some bonus tips, optional projects, or additional depth on certain topics.
