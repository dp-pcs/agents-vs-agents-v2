Rationale:

1. **Why this order makes sense:** The curriculum starts with the basics of machine learning and gradually moves to more complex topics. It begins with an introduction to machine learning, then dives into different types of learning (supervised and unsupervised). After building a strong foundation, the user moves on to neural networks and deep learning, which are the basis for understanding large language models. The curriculum then moves to natural language processing and large language models, which are more advanced topics. The curriculum ends with a discussion on the ethics of AI and a review of AI, which are important for any AI practitioner.

2. **How it balances theory + practice:** The curriculum balances theory and practice by including hands-on projects every 3-4 weeks. These projects allow the user to apply what they have learned in a practical setting. The projects increase in complexity over time, starting with a simple regression task and ending with implementing a transformer model.

3. **What the user should know by the end:** By the end of this curriculum, the user should have a solid understanding of the core foundations of machine learning, how large language models work, and how to implement these models in practice. They should also be aware of the ethical considerations in AI and have a broad understanding of the field of AI.
