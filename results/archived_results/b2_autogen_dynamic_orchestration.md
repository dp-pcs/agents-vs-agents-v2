  - **ConclusionAgent**: To synthesize the plan's overall strategic view.

- **Excluded Agents**:
  - **BaseballCoachAgent** and similar agents are excluded as they are unrelated to the business and strategic planning for an AI productivity app.

The coordination of these components ensures a well-rounded plan addressing all facets of the app launch, from initial research and strategy to execution and post-launch analysis.
