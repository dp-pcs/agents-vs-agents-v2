## CrewAI with OpenAI Output

Here is the 12-week curriculum designed to help you become proficient in AI and Machine Learning:

| Week | Topics | Resources | Project |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Introduction to Machine Learning | [Coursera: Machine Learning by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) (Week 1) | - |
| 2 | Linear Regression | Coursera: Machine Learning by Andrew Ng (Week 2) | - |
| 3 | Logistic Regression | Coursera: Machine Learning by Andrew Ng (Week 3) | Project 1: Predicting House Prices using Linear Regression |
| 4 | Neural Networks: Basics | Coursera: Machine Learning by Andrew Ng (Week 4) | - |
| 5 | Neural Networks: Deep Learning | Coursera: Machine Learning by Andrew Ng (Week 5) | - |
| 6 | Advice for Applying Machine Learning, Machine Learning System Design | Coursera: Machine Learning by Andrew Ng (Week 6) | Project 2: Image Classification using Neural Networks |
| 7 | Support Vector Machines (SVMs) | Coursera: Machine Learning by Andrew Ng (Week 7) | - |
| 8 | Unsupervised Learning, Dimensionality Reduction | Coursera: Machine Learning by Andrew Ng (Week 8) | - |
| 9 | Anomaly Detection, Recommender Systems | Coursera: Machine Learning by Andrew Ng (Week 9) | Project 3: Building a Movie Recommender System |
| 10 | Introduction to Large Language Models | [OpenAI: GPT-3 Creative Writing](https://beta.openai.com/examples/) | - |
| 11 | Fine-tuning Large Language Models | [Hugging Face: Fine-tuning a pretrained model](https://huggingface.co/transformers/training.html) | - |
| 12 | Application of Large Language Models | [OpenAI: ChatGPT](https://openai.com/research/chatgpt) | Project 4: Building a Chatbot using GPT-3 |

This order makes sense because it starts with the basics of machine learning, gradually moving to more complex topics like neural networks, SVMs, and unsupervised learning. The curriculum then transitions to large language models, starting with an introduction and moving to fine-tuning and application.

The curriculum balances theory and practice by including a hands-on project every three weeks. These projects are designed to apply the concepts learned in the preceding weeks.

By the end of this curriculum, the user should have a solid understanding of machine learning algorithms, neural networks, and large language models. They should also have practical experience applying these concepts to real-world datasets.

## Claude Evaluation

Here is the evaluation of the generated 12-week AI/ML curriculum plan:

| Category | Score (1-5) |
| --- | --- |
| Task Execution | 4 |
| Output Clarity | 5 |
| Error Recovery | 4 |
| Autonomy & Initiative | 3 |
| **Total Score** | **16** |

Feedback summary:
The generated curriculum plan effectively covers the core foundations of machine learning and large language models, with a well-structured progression from basic to advanced topics. The inclusion of hands-on projects every 3-4 weeks provides a good balance of theory and practice. The output is presented in a clear and readable markdown table format. However, the plan could benefit from additional resources beyond the Coursera course and more depth on certain topics like SVMs and dimensionality reduction. Some bonus tips or optional advanced projects would also demonstrate greater initiative.
