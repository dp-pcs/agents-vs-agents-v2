Summary:
This curriculum starts with the fundamentals of machine learning, including key concepts, supervised learning algorithms like regression and classification, and unsupervised learning techniques like clustering. It includes the popular Coursera Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng.

Next, it dives into deep learning, covering neural networks, best practices for training deep models, CNNs for computer vision, and RNNs for sequence data. The Coursera Deep Learning Specialization courses are the core resource. Hands-on projects in weeks 3 and 6 help cement these skills.

In the final weeks, the curriculum covers modern transformer-based language models. It explains the key innovations of the transformer architecture and how it powers models like BERT and GPT. Tutorials and articles are the main resources here. Another project in week 9 provides practice.

The curriculum culminates in a capstone project in week 12, where the user selects a Kaggle competition to apply their skills end-to-end.

By the end, the user should have a strong grasp of core machine learning and deep learning concepts, know how cutting-edge language models work, and have substantial hands-on experience building models. The mix of courses, articles, and projects balances theory and application. The ascending difficulty ensures a smooth learning curve.
