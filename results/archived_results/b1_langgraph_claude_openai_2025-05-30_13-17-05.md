Summary:
This curriculum starts with the core foundations of machine learning, including key algorithms like linear regression, logistic regression, SVMs, and unsupervised learning methods. It includes Andrew Ng's popular Machine Learning course on Coursera to build a solid theoretical foundation.

It then progresses into deep learning, starting with the basics of neural networks and techniques for training them effectively. The deeplearning.ai specialization courses provide a thorough treatment of modern deep learning methods.

Hands-on projects are included every few weeks to reinforce the concepts learned and provide practical experience. These projects increase in complexity over time.

The final weeks cover more advanced topics like sequence models, transformers, and large language models. By the end, the learner will understand the core ML algorithms, know how to build and train various neural network architectures, and have experience working with state-of-the-art NLP models. 

The mix of high-quality courses, textbook readings, and practical projects provides a balance of theory and application. The projects in particular will help solidify understanding and build a portfolio to showcase. Following this curriculum should give someone a strong foundation in AI/ML and open up opportunities for more advanced studies and applications.
