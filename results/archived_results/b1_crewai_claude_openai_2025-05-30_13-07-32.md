## OpenAI Evaluation

focus on large language models. The order of topics starts from the basics of machine learning, gradually introducing more complex concepts like neural networks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and finally large language models. This order makes sense as it allows the user to build a solid foundation before moving on to more advanced topics.

The curriculum balances theory and practice by including hands-on projects every 3-4 weeks. These projects allow the user to apply the concepts they've learned in a practical setting, using real datasets. By the end of the 12 weeks, the user should have a strong understanding of machine learning and AI, and be able to build and fine-tune large language models.

Feedback Summary:
The AI coach has done an excellent job in designing a comprehensive and progressive learning plan for the user. The plan not only covers the core foundations of machine learning but also gradually introduces more complex topics such as neural networks and large language models. The inclusion of hands-on projects at regular intervals ensures that the user gets to apply the theoretical knowledge in a practical setting. The resources provided are also well-chosen, offering a mix of video lectures and reading materials. The plan is clear, well-structured, and fulfills all the user's requirements and constraints.
