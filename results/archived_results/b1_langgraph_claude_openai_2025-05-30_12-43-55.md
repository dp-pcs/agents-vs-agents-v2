Summary:
This curriculum starts with the fundamental concepts and algorithms of machine learning, including different types of supervised learning methods like linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, SVMs, KNN, and Naive Bayes. Hands-on projects in weeks 4 and 8 provide practice applying these to real prediction and classification tasks.

The plan then introduces unsupervised learning and clustering algorithms like k-means. Finally, it

## OpenAI Evaluation

covers the basics of neural networks, including perceptrons, backpropagation, CNNs, and RNNs, with a final project to build a CNN for image classification.

This order makes sense because it starts with simpler, foundational concepts and gradually introduces more complex topics. The hands-on projects provide opportunities to apply the theory in practice, reinforcing the learning. By the end of this curriculum, the user should have a solid understanding of the core concepts and techniques in machine learning and be able to build their own ML models for various tasks.
