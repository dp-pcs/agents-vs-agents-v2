**Summary:**

This curriculum starts with the basics of machine learning, gradually introducing more complex concepts and techniques. The first 8 weeks are dedicated to Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course, which provides a solid foundation in machine learning theory and practice. The course includes programming exercises that allow the user to apply what they've learned.

The next 4 weeks focus on large language models, starting with an introduction to transformers. The resources for these weeks are blog posts by Jay Alammar, which provide clear, visual explanations of these complex models. 

The curriculum includes three hands-on projects, which are designed to give the user practical experience with the techniques they've learned. The first project involves using linear regression to predict house prices, the second involves using neural networks for digit recognition, and the third involves using transformers for text classification.

By the end of this curriculum, the user should have a strong understanding of machine learning, including how to train and use both traditional machine learning models and large language models. They should also have practical experience applying these models to real-world datasets.

## Claude Evaluation

Here is my evaluation of the generated learning plan:

| Category | Score (1-5) |
| --- | --- |
| Task Execution | 5 |
| Output Clarity | 5 |
| Error Recovery | 4 |
| Autonomy & Initiative | 4 |

**Feedback Summary:**
The generated learning plan does an excellent job of progressively building machine learning knowledge over the 12 week period, starting with foundational concepts and moving into more advanced topics like neural networks and transformers. The inclusion of Andrew Ng's course and the illustrated blog posts provides high-quality learning resources. The hands-on projects are well-spaced and relevant to the material. 

The only areas for potential improvement would be 1) Possibly including a few supplemental resources beyond just the main course/posts each week, and 2) Providing a bit more specificity on what each hands-on project entails. But overall, this is a very comprehensive and well-structured plan that fulfills the key requirements.
