## CrewAI with OpenAI Output

Here is a 12-week curriculum designed to progressively build your understanding of AI and machine learning:

| Week | Topics | Resources | Project |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Introduction to Machine Learning | [Intro to Machine Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120) | - |
| 2 | Supervised Learning | [Supervised Learning with scikit-learn](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/supervised-learning-with-scikit-learn) | - |
| 3 | Unsupervised Learning | [Unsupervised Learning in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/unsupervised-learning-in-python) | - |
| 4 | Project 1: Supervised and Unsupervised Learning | - | Apply supervised and unsupervised learning techniques on a real dataset |
| 5 | Introduction to Neural Networks | [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning) | - |
| 6 | Convolutional Neural Networks | [Convolutional Neural Networks](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks) | - |
| 7 | Recurrent Neural Networks | [Sequence Models](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nlp-sequence-models) | - |
| 8 | Project 2: Neural Networks | - | Apply neural networks to a real dataset |
| 9 | Introduction to Large Language Models | [Transformers for Natural Language Processing](https://www.coursera.org/learn/transformers-nlp) | - |
| 10 | Advanced Topics in Large Language Models | [Attention is All You Need paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) | - |
| 11 | Hands-on with Large Language Models | [Hugging Face's Transformers library](https://huggingface.co/transformers/) | - |
| 12 | Project 3: Large Language Models | - | Apply a transformer model to a real dataset |

This order makes sense because it starts with the basics of machine learning, then moves on to more complex topics like neural networks and large language models. It balances theory and practice by including a hands-on project every 3-4 weeks. By the end of this curriculum, you should have a solid understanding of machine learning and large language models, and have hands-on experience applying these concepts to real datasets.

## Claude Evaluation

Here is my evaluation of the generated 12-week AI/ML learning plan:

| Category | Score (1-5) |
| --- | --- |
| Task Execution | 5 |
| Output Clarity | 5 |
| Error Recovery | 4 |
| Autonomy & Initiative | 3 |
| **Total Score** | **17** |

**Feedback Summary:**
The generated learning plan does an excellent job fulfilling the user's requirements and constraints. It covers the requested topics in a logical progression, includes hands-on projects at regular intervals, and provides specific resource recommendations with links. The output is well-structured and easy to follow. 

The plan avoids major pitfalls by starting with ML fundamentals before diving into more advanced topics. However, it could have provided a bit more guidance on prerequisite math/stats knowledge needed.

In terms of going above and beyond, the plan sticks pretty closely to the user's stated goals. It could have shown more initiative by suggesting some optional stretch goals, additional projects, or complementary topics to explore.
