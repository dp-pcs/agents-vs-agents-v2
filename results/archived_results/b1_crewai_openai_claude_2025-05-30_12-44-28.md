## CrewAI with OpenAI Output

Here is a 12-week curriculum designed to progressively build your knowledge and skills in AI and machine learning. 

| Week | Topics | Resources | Project |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Introduction to Machine Learning | [Coursera: Machine Learning by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) (Week 1) | - |
| 2 | Linear Regression with One Variable | Coursera: Machine Learning by Andrew Ng (Week 2) | - |
| 3 | Linear Algebra Review, Linear Regression with Multiple Variables | Coursera: Machine Learning by Andrew Ng (Week 3) | Project 1: Predicting House Prices using Linear Regression |
| 4 | Logistic Regression, Regularization | Coursera: Machine Learning by Andrew Ng (Week 4) | - |
| 5 | Neural Networks: Representation | Coursera: Machine Learning by Andrew Ng (Week 5) | - |
| 6 | Neural Networks: Learning | Coursera: Machine Learning by Andrew Ng (Week 6) | Project 2: Handwritten Digit Recognition using Neural Networks |
| 7 | Advice for Applying Machine Learning, Machine Learning System Design | Coursera: Machine Learning by Andrew Ng (Week 7) | - |
| 8 | Support Vector Machines (SVMs) | Coursera: Machine Learning by Andrew Ng (Week 8) | - |
| 9 | Unsupervised Learning, Dimensionality Reduction | Coursera: Machine Learning by Andrew Ng (Week 9) | Project 3: Image Compression using K-Means Clustering |
| 10 | Anomaly Detection, Recommender Systems | Coursera: Machine Learning by Andrew Ng (Week 10) | - |
| 11 | Introduction to Large Language Models | [OpenAI: GPT-3 Creative Writing](https://beta.openai.com/playground/) | - |
| 12 | Building Projects with GPT-3 | [OpenAI: GPT-3 API](https://beta.openai.com/docs/) | Project 4: Building a Chatbot using GPT-3 |

This order makes sense because it starts with the basics of machine learning, gradually moving to more complex topics like neural networks and SVMs. It then introduces large language models, specifically GPT-3, and ends with a project to apply what you've learned.

The curriculum balances theory and practice by including a hands-on project every 3-4 weeks. These projects are designed to apply the concepts learned in the preceding weeks.

By the end of this curriculum, you should have a solid understanding of the core foundations of machine learning, how large language models work, and have experience building projects using real datasets.

## Claude Evaluation

Here is my evaluation of the generated 12-week AI/ML learning plan:

| Category | Score (1-5) |
| --- | --- |
| Task Execution | 5 |
| Output Clarity | 5 |
| Error Recovery | 4 |
| Autonomy & Initiative | 4 |
| **Total Score** | **18** |

Feedback Summary:
The generated learning plan does an excellent job fulfilling all the specified constraints and user needs. It covers the core foundations of machine learning, includes hands-on projects, and introduces large language models like GPT-3. The output is very well-structured, using a clear markdown table format. The plan avoids major pitfalls by starting with foundational topics and gradually increasing in complexity. It shows good initiative by including a variety of projects and resources. One potential improvement could be adding a few supplemental reading suggestions to dive deeper into certain topics.
