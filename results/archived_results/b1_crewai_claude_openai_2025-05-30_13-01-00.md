This learning plan starts with the basics of machine learning, introducing the types of ML and the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning. It then progresses to specific algorithms, starting with simpler ones like linear and logistic regression, and gradually moving to more complex ones like decision trees, SVMs, and ensemble methods. 

The first project at the end of week 4 allows the user to apply their knowledge of regression in a practical setting. The curriculum then moves on to unsupervised learning and clustering before the second project in week 8, which involves customer segmentation using K-means clustering.

The last four weeks are dedicated to neural networks and deep learning, with the final project allowing the user to choose between image classification and sentiment analysis. This progression ensures a solid foundation in machine learning before moving on to more advanced topics.

The plan balances theory and practice by alternating between learning new concepts and applying them in projects. By the end of the 12 weeks, the user should have a good understanding of the core concepts of machine learning and deep learning, and have practical experience in applying these concepts to real-world datasets.
