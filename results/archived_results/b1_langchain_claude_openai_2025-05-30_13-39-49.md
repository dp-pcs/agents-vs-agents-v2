## LangChain with Claude Output

content='Here is the 12-week AI/ML learning plan:\n\n| Week | Topics | Resources | Project |\n|------|--------|-----------|---------|\n| 1 | Machine Learning Fundamentals | [Coursera Machine Learning Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) Weeks 1-2 | - |  \n| 2 | Supervised Learning Algorithms | Coursera ML Course Weeks 3-4 | - |\n| 3 | Unsupervised Learning | Coursera ML Course Week 8 | - |\n| 4 | ML Foundations Review | [Hands-On Machine Learning Book](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/) Chapters 1-3 | **Project 1:** Build ML models to predict housing prices using [California Housing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices) |\n| 5 | Neural Networks Basics | [Neural Networks and Deep Learning Book](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) Chapters 1-3 | - |\n| 6 | Training Neural Networks | Neural Networks and Deep Learning Book Chapters 4-6 | - |  \n| 7 | Convolutional Neural Networks | Hands-On ML Book Chapter 14 | - |\n| 8 | CNN Architectures | [CS231n Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](https://cs231n.github.io/) Module 2 | **Project 2:** Train a CNN to classify images from the [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) |\n| 9 | Recurrent Neural Networks | Hands-On ML Book Chapter 15 | - |\n| 10 | Transformers and Attention | [Illustrated Transformer Blog Post](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/) | - |\n| 11 | Transfer Learning & Fine-Tuning | Hands-On ML Book Chapter 11 | - | \n| 12 | Capstone Project | - | **Final Project:** Fine-tune a pre-trained language model on a text classification task of your choice |\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThis curriculum starts with the foundational concepts of machine learning, including supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms. It then progresses to neural networks and deep learning, covering the basics of training neural nets. The plan dives deeper into specific architectures like CNNs and RNNs, before introducing more advanced topics like transformers and transfer learning.\n\nThe order allows the learner to build a strong theoretical foundation first, then apply those concepts in practice through hands-on projects. The projects are spaced out to reinforce learning and gradually increase in complexity.\n\nBy the end of the 12 weeks, the learner should have a solid understanding of key ML concepts, experience implementing models in Python, and familiarity with important architectures used in modern AI systems. They will be well-equipped to pursue more advanced studies or projects independently.\n\n### Evaluation:\n\n| Category | Score (1-5) |\n|----------|-------------|\n| Task Execution | 5 |\n| Output Clarity | 5 |  \n| Error Recovery | 4 |\n| Autonomy & Initiative | 4 |\n| **Total Score** | **18** |\n\n**Feedback:** The learning plan comprehensively covers the requested topics in a logical progression, includes relevant resources and hands-on projects, and scales up in difficulty appropriately. The breakdown into weekly themes is clear and the projects align well with the concepts taught. \n\nThe plan could be improved slightly by providing more backup resources or optional advanced topics for students who progress more quickly. But overall it executes well on the key requirements and provides a solid path to proficiency in ML fundamentals.\n\n**Time to complete:** 1087.43 seconds' additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'id': 'msg_01QXCJ55QbDWzHh3iTFvcTC8', 'model': 'claude-3-opus-20240229', 'stop_reason': 'end_turn', 'stop_sequence': None, 'usage': {'cache_creation_input_tokens': 0, 'cache_read_input_tokens': 0, 'input_tokens': 486, 'output_tokens': 905, 'server_tool_use': None, 'service_tier': 'standard'}, 'model_name': 'claude-3-opus-20240229'} id='run--08e753ee-60ca-4fd7-91d4-fa3044278797-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 486, 'output_tokens': 905, 'total_tokens': 1391, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0, 'cache_creation': 0}}

## OpenAI Evaluation

content="### Evaluation:\n\n| Category                  | Score (1-5) |\n|---------------------------|-------------|\n| Task Execution            | 5           |\n| Output Clarity            | 5           |\n| Error Recovery            | 5           |\n| Autonomy & Initiative     | 4           |\n| **Total Score**           | **19**      |\n\n**Feedback:** The AI has done an excellent job in creating a comprehensive 12-week learning plan for the user. It has considered the user's existing knowledge and the time they have available each week. The plan is well-structured, with a clear progression from basic to more advanced topics, and includes relevant resources and hands-on projects. The AI has also provided a clear and concise summary explaining the logic behind the order of topics, how the plan balances theory and practice, and what the user should know by the end. The only area for improvement could be the inclusion of additional resources or optional advanced topics for faster learners, hence the score of 4 in Autonomy & Initiative. Overall, this is a high-quality output that meets all the user's requirements.\n\n**Time to complete:** 1087.43 seconds" additional_kwargs={'refusal': None} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 234, 'prompt_tokens': 1451, 'total_tokens': 1685, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4-0613', 'system_fingerprint': None, 'id': 'chatcmpl-BczrohzQEeh0G2WeSdjTin1rDvuF5', 'service_tier': 'default', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='run--6454dff4-bfc5-4763-ab82-f31d24b63c6c-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1451, 'output_tokens': 234, 'total_tokens': 1685, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}
