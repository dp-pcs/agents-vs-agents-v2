content="Here is the 12-week AI/ML learning plan:\n\n| Week | Topics | Resources | Project |\n|------|--------|-----------|---------|\n| 1 | Intro to Machine Learning, Types of ML | [Coursera: Intro to Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) Week 1 | - |  \n| 2 | Linear Regression, Gradient Descent | Coursera Week 2 | - |\n| 3 | Logistic Regression, Regularization | Coursera Week 3 | - |\n| 4 | Neural Networks, Activation Functions | Coursera Week 4 | Build a simple neural network to classify handwritten digits from MNIST dataset |\n| 5 | Advice for ML projects, Bias/Variance, Regularization | Coursera Week 5-6 | - |\n| 6 | Support Vector Machines, Kernels | Coursera Week 7 | - |\n| 7 | Unsupervised Learning, K-Means, PCA | Coursera Week 8 | Perform customer segmentation using K-Means on retail dataset |\n| 8 | Anomaly Detection, Recommender Systems | Coursera Week 9 | - |\n| 9 | Intro to Deep Learning, Convolutional Neural Networks | [deeplearning.ai CNN course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks) Week 1-2 | - |  \n| 10 | CNN Architectures, Transfer Learning | CNN course Week 3-4 | Build an image classifier using transfer learning on a Kaggle dataset |\n| 11 | Recurrent Neural Networks, LSTMs, Word Embeddings | [Sequence Models course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nlp-sequence-models) Week 1-2 | - |\n| 12 | Transformer Architecture, BERT, GPT | [Hugging Face Transformers tutorials](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter1) | Fine-tune a pre-trained language model on a text classification task |\n\n**Summary:**\nThis plan starts with the foundational concepts of machine learning, including different types of algorithms, key concepts like bias/variance tradeoff, and regularization. It then progresses to more advanced topics in deep learning, starting with the basics of neural networks before diving into CNNs, RNNs, and finally the transformer architecture that powers large language models.\n\nThe plan balances theory and practice by including hands-on projects every few weeks that allow the learner to implement the concepts they've learned on real datasets. By the end, the user should have a solid understanding of the key ideas in ML and deep learning, and practical experience building projects using popular frameworks and techniques.\n\n### Evaluation:\n\n| Category | Score (1-5) |\n|----------|-------------|\n| Task Execution | 5 |\n| Output Clarity | 5 |  \n| Error Recovery | 4 |\n| Autonomy & Initiative | 4 |\n\n**Feedback:** The generated plan does an excellent job meeting all the specified requirements and constraints. It covers the core ML concepts and builds up to more advanced deep learning topics in a logical progression. The output is very well-structured and readable. The plan could potentially be improved by including a few more optional stretch goals or challenge problems for highly motivated learners. But overall it's a comprehensive, well-designed curriculum.\n\n**Total Score:** 18/20\n\n**Time to complete:** 254.87 seconds" additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'id': 'msg_01EdLtwqMhCqzX6GFAFFXChT', 'model': 'claude-3-opus-20240229', 'stop_reason': 'end_turn', 'stop_sequence': None, 'usage': {'cache_creation_input_tokens': 0, 'cache_read_input_tokens': 0, 'input_tokens': 486, 'output_tokens': 819, 'server_tool_use': None, 'service_tier': 'standard'}, 'model_name': 'claude-3-opus-20240229'} id='run--4bebf557-4e84-442e-8ca3-b3ac03914574-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 486, 'output_tokens': 819, 'total_tokens': 1305, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0, 'cache_creation': 0}}

## OpenAI Evaluation

content='| Category            | Score (1-5) |\n|---------------------|-------------|\n| Task Execution      | 5           |\n| Output Clarity      | 5           |\n| Error Recovery      | 5           |\n| Autonomy & Initiative | 5          |\n\n**Feedback:** The AI has done an excellent job in creating a comprehensive and progressive 12-week learning plan for AI and Machine Learning. The plan starts with the basics and gradually moves towards more complex topics, ensuring a smooth learning curve. The inclusion of hands-on projects at regular intervals is a great way to reinforce learning and provide practical experience. The resources provided are specific and relevant, which will be very helpful for the learner. The summary at the end neatly explains the rationale behind the order of topics and the balance between theory and practice. The AI also shows initiative by suggesting the learner to fine-tune a pre-trained language model on a text classification task, which is a great way to understand how large language models work.\n\n**Total Score:** 20/20\n\n**Time to complete:** 254.87 seconds' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 218, 'prompt_tokens': 1386, 'total_tokens': 1604, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4-0613', 'system_fingerprint': None, 'id': 'chatcmpl-BczJwjoKhBz8ytK1CZQsgnh7pex72', 'service_tier': 'default', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='run--f422b123-a8be-4dcc-9413-02fbd48d58d3-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1386, 'output_tokens': 218, 'total_tokens': 1604, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}
