## OpenAI Evaluation

| Project |
|---------|
| Project 4: Text generation with GPT-2 |

This curriculum starts with the basics of machine learning and gradually introduces more complex topics. The first two weeks are dedicated to understanding the core concepts of machine learning and linear regression. The third week introduces logistic regression and evaluation metrics, and the first project gives the user a chance to apply these concepts.

The curriculum then moves on to neural networks and their types - CNNs and RNNs. Each type of network is followed by a project that allows the user to apply the concepts learned.

The seventh week introduces language models and word embeddings, which are essential for understanding large language models. The following weeks cover attention mechanisms, transformers, and popular models like BERT and GPT.

The last three weeks introduce unsupervised learning, dimensionality reduction, and reinforcement learning. The final project allows the user to apply their knowledge of large language models.

By the end of this curriculum, the user should have a solid understanding of machine learning and AI, and have hands-on experience with several types of projects.
