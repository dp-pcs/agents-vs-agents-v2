**Summary:**

This learning plan starts with the basics of machine learning, gradually introducing more complex concepts and techniques. The first few weeks focus on understanding the fundamental algorithms like linear and logistic regression. The plan then moves on to neural networks, which form the basis for understanding large language models. 

The hands-on projects are designed to provide practical experience with the concepts learned. They are spread out every 3-4 weeks to ensure that the learner has a good grasp of the theoretical concepts before applying them. 

By the end of this plan, the learner should have a solid understanding of the core foundations of machine learning, including how to implement various algorithms and how to design and evaluate machine learning systems. They will also have a basic understanding of neural networks, which will provide a stepping stone to understanding more complex models like transformers. 

This plan provides a balance between theory and practice, ensuring that the learner not only understands the concepts but also knows how to apply them. The projects provide practical experience with real datasets, reinforcing the theoretical knowledge gained from the courses.
