## OpenAI Evaluation

| Unsupervised Clustering Model |

By the end of this curriculum, the user will have a solid understanding of the core foundations of machine learning, including various types of algorithms, how to preprocess data, and how to evaluate models. They will also have a basic understanding of deep learning and natural language processing, including how large language models work. The user will have built three hands-on projects, giving them practical experience in applying what they have learned.

The order of the curriculum makes sense because it starts with the basics of machine learning and gradually introduces more complex topics. The first few weeks focus on understanding the types of machine learning algorithms and how to preprocess data. The middle weeks delve into specific algorithms and concepts, and the last few weeks introduce more advanced topics like deep learning and natural language processing. This structure allows the user to build on their knowledge each week.

The curriculum balances theory and practice by including a hands-on project every 3-4 weeks. These projects give the user the opportunity to apply the concepts they have learned and gain practical experience. The projects increase in complexity over time, starting with building a regression model and ending with building an unsupervised clustering model.

### Evaluation:

| Category | Score |
|----------|-------|
| Task Execution | 5 |
| Output Clarity | 5 |
| Error Recovery | 5 |
| Autonomy & Initiative | 5 |
| **Total** | **20/20** |

**Feedback Summary:**  
The AI did an excellent job in creating a comprehensive 12-week learning plan. It followed the user's constraints and needs, and it progressively built up the complexity of the topics. The AI also included relevant resources for each topic and ensured a balance between theory and practice with the inclusion of hands-on projects. The output was clear and well-structured, making it easy for the user to follow.
