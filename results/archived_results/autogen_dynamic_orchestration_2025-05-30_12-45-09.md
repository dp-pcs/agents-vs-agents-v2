## Business Plan Content

Rationale:

To develop a comprehensive business plan for launching a new AI productivity app, I engaged experts to cover all essential areas of the business strategy:

1. **Executive Summary** - To succinctly summarize the business's aims and goals.
2. **Market Analysis** - To provide insights into the industry, competition, and buyer personas.
3. **Product Strategy** - To outline the features and unique value proposition of the AI productivity app.
4. **Go-to-Market Plan** - To establish a marketing strategy, including channels and messaging.
5. **Financial Projections** - To present expected financials that will help in tracking the financial health of the venture.
6. **Team & Roles** - To delineate the team structure necessary for execution.
7. **Risks & Mitigation** - To identify potential risks and provide strategies to mitigate them.
8. **12-Week Rollout Timeline** - To plan out the operational timeline and ensure seamless execution.
9. **Conclusion** - To recap and reinforce the core arguments for the business's success.

Agents not used in this task include ones irrelevant to the business domain or function, such as a **BaseballCoachAgent**, as their expertise does not directly contribute toward tech product development or business strategy.

Through careful section development by each expert agent, every aspect of launching the AI productivity app is cohesively addressed, ensuring a well-rounded business plan ready for execution.
